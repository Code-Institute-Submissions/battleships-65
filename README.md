# Battleships game
This game is a single player game designed for users to compete against the computer in a game of logic and chance. The player must sink all the computers battleships by making estimations on where the battleships are located on a 5 x 5, 8 x 8 or 10 x 10 battle grid. The game provides value to users who are interested in playing online games that provide them with the opportunity of playing against the computer.

## Design
The grids are designed to display in the center of screens with the positions allocated by a number and letter system. The grid size displayed depends on the users game choice.

The functions and validation checks were planned and designed with lucidchart.

## Existing Features
The user is welcomed to the game where a short explanation is provided. The user is requested that they input their username and the grid size they wish to play.

The user grid is displayed showing the location of the battleships and the computers board is displayed. A prompt is issued to the user to choose a position. Validation is in place here so only numbers and letters can be used.

The user's score is displayed and incremented when a user sinks one of the computers battleships and vice versa. A game over screen appears whenever a player sinks the required number of battleships.
